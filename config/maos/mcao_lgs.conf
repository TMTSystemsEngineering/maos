#File mcao_lgs.conf
#A basic LGS MCAO system with no implementation errors

#This .conf file contains the complete configuration of TMT NFIRAOS System.  You

#choose different parameters. This file is loaded by maos automatically if \c -c

#All string must be quoted with ""
#Vectors should be embraced by [].

#tydeg: the y tilt angle in degree wrt beam (90 is prep), 
#ftel: The telescope effective focal length, 
#fexit: the distance between the exit pupil and the focus, 
#fsurf: the distance between the M3 and the focus.

#Important: The OPD should cover more area (1/2 meter each side) than meta pupil for interpolation.
