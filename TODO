Migrate to openmp instead of using hand tuned pthreads in a branch. Test performance.

A list of TODOs
*) Do a zernike decomposition of atmosphere, corrected atmosphere, DM commands, etc Test the generated atmosphere
*) Look into sub harmornic method to create enough tip/tilt. (Generate tip/tilt and low order screens with coarse sampling but large scale. Then add the correction to the generated atmosphere.)
*) Write a Fresnel propagator to study near field effects.
*) Instead of using independent routine drawdaemon, consider using plugin like library like matlab. dynamically load the library if need to draw plots.
*) Revisint LLT geomtry. keep same sampling as subaperture. But can have more points. The resulted otf have the same sampling of the subaperture image and can be mutiplied directly.
*) Implement split tomography for single conjugate mode?
